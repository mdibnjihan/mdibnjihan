# Hey there!
üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚öß :octocat: I am an <b>open source programmer</b>. I am passionate about building amazing projects that make user life easier.
My code name: <code>$BlueKat</code>
# Skills
Though, I try to work with most popular programming languages as I beleive in choosing the right language for the right task thus writing a more maintainable code and optimizing the workflow. Though, here are list of some languages and framework that I am familiar with. But, I try to apply concepts and my problem solving skills to solve an issue in any given stack.</br>
<b>HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React JS | Next JS | SQL | MongoDB | C# | C/C++ | Kotlin | Flutter | Java |</b>

# Contributing
I mostly focus on creating small tools that make my everyday coding easier. If an amazing tools that might be helpful to anyone those repositories are made public. 
- Public repositories only store non-copyright, <i>free to use/resue code</i> and <b>non-commercial</b> use with no author credit is permitted. (The policy/liscence that is associated with the repository might be different but the purpose remains the same.)
- Private repositories are not available but could sometimes require a few eyes to maintain and develop. That is due to propietery codebase or part of one. Access to such repositories is often limited and generally friends at work.
- If you want to introduce a patch it is recommended to make your own version (fork) it and publish it with the patch. It is hard for me to maintain projects that are released to public. Still you can create a PR and I will try to fix it as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience.
- For creating a PR please be clear about the issue it fixes, I will review it as soon as possible and merge it.
Thank you being a part of the journey.</br>
